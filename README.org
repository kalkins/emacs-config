* My Emacs config

This repo contains my configuration file for emacs.
It is written in org mode using code blocks that get
executed at launch. A pretty html version of the
config can be found [[http://sindrestephansen.com/emacs-config][here]].

Everyone is free to use this however they want, but
you'll probably want to change some of the settings
before actually using it.

** Setup

Clone this repo to =~/.emacs.d=, or use chemacs.
Then start emacs. The first launch will take some time.
